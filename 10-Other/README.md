# Examples Overview

| Sample     | Description |
| ---------- | ----------  |
| **[Body Tracking](body%20tracking)** | Shows how to detect and track 3D human bodies in space and display skeletons over the live image. | 
| **[Camera Control](camera%20control)** | Shows how to adjust the ZED Camera parameters (exposure, gain, contrast, ...). | 
| **[Camera Streaming](camera%20streaming)** | Shows how to stream and receive a ZED Camera video feed on local network. | 
| **[Depth Sensing](depth%20sensing)** | Shows how to capture a 3D point cloud and display it in an OpenGL window. | 
| **[Object Detection](object%20detection)** | Shows how to use the Object Detection module with the ZED2/ZED2i/ZED-M. Two display modes are available (2D/3D). |
| **[Plane Detection](plane%20detection)** | Shows how to detect floor and planar areas in the scene and draw them on the image. |
| **[Positional Tracking](positional%20tracking)** | Shows how to use the Positional Tracking module. The live position and orientation of the camera is displayed in a 3D window. | 
| **[Spatial Mapping](spatial%20mapping)** | Shows how to capture a mesh with the ZED and display it with OpenGL. Classic Mesh and Point Cloud fusion are available. | 
| **[SVO Recording](svo%20recording)** | Shows how to [record](svo%20recording/recording) and [playback](svo%20recording/playback) video files in SVO format, and later [export](svo%20recording/export) them in different common formats. SVO files lets you use all the ZED SDK features without having a ZED connected. | 
| **[Other](other)** | Other general samples that demonstrate the use of the ZED SDK. |
