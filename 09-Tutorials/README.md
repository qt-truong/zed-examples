# Tutorials Overview

This series of basic tutorials demonstrates the use of each API module. It is recommended to start from the [first tutorial](tutorial%201%20-%20hello%20ZED) to get familiar with your camera. Note that no graphical window will be displayed when running these tutorials.

| Tutorial     | Description | Links |
| ---------- | ----------  | ---------- |
| **[Hello ZED](tutorial%201%20-%20hello%20ZED)** | This is the simplest tutorial. It shows how to open a stereo camera and print its serial number in the terminal. | 
| **[Image Capture](tutorial%202%20-%20image%20capture)** | Shows how to open a stereo camera, capture an image and print its timestamp and image size in the terminal. |
| **[Depth Sensing](tutorial%203%20-%20depth%20sensing)** | Shows how to retrieve depth and point cloud of a scene, and print the distance of a given point in the terminal. |
| **[Positional Tracking](tutorial%204%20-%20positional%20tracking)** | Shows how to get the position and orientation of the camera in real time and print its IMU data in the terminal. |
| **[Spatial Mapping](tutorial%205%20-%20spatial%20mapping)** | Shows how to enable spatial mapping to capture, filter and save a mesh or fused point cloud of the environment as an `.obj` file |
| **[3D Object Detection](tutorial%206%20-%20object%20detection)** | Shows how to detect objects in a scene and localize them in 3D (available for ZED 2/ZED 2i/ZED Mini). |
| **[Sensor Data](tutorial%207%20-%20sensor%20data)** | Shows how to retrieve sensor data (available for ZED 2/ZED 2i/ZED Mini). |
| **[Body Tracking](tutorial%208%20-%20body%20tracking)** | Shows how to use the human body module with the ZED 2/ZED 2i/ZED Mini. |
